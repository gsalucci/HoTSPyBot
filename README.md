# HoTS Py Bot

This is a pixel scanner (on steroids) bot for Heroes of The Storm, a MOBA by Blizzard
This projects makes extensive use of the OpenCV2 library for python, it uses threads and processes to parallelize the screen analysis making data acquisition really fast and on par with human performace.

The goal for this bot is to play and win games VS AI with the help of machine learning algorithms (in the future), in the current state the bot can determine:
* Game State
  * Lobby
  * Roster
  * Loading Screen (and map side)
  * Thanks screen
  * In game screen
  * mvp screen
  * after-game screen (leave screen)
Once in game it can track:
* Own hero HP
* Map:
  * own structures
  * enemy structures
  * camps / objectives
  * Player position (dodgy)

All this is possible tanks to the use of the opencv2 library.
It uses 2 types of matching, color matching and tempalte matching to determine the game state and track structures players and hp. 

The short-term goal is to make it gather enough data to feed to the ML algorithm.

You can checkout app state updating in real-time at http://localhost:3000
websocket and webapp server needs a redis instance running you can configure the connection string to the redis instanbce by
creating a .env file, inside it enter:

REDIS=redis://default:password@host:port

password is optional, depends on redis server configuration.

To run the bot, the first time, you will need to: 

cd Utils
python templateFIleBuilder.py

this will create the templates.pickle file needed to template match stuff.

Data that remains to be acquired:
1. enemy and allied heroes position in the hero's FoV
2. track enemy and friendly minions in the hero FoV
3. Teams' level (OCR)
4. Own cooldowns (OCR)
5. determine What own spells do (it needs to be as generic as possible) ?
