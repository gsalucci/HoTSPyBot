# HoTS Py Bot

This is a pixel scanner (on steroids) bot for Heroes of The Storm, a MOBA by Blizzard
This projects makes extensive use of the OpenCV2 library for python, it uses threads and processes to parallelize the screen analysis making data acquisition really fast and on par with human performace.

The goal for this bot is to play and win games VS AI with the help of machine learning algorithms (in the future), in the current state the bot can determine:
* Game State
  * Lobby
  * Roster
  * Loading Screen (and map side)
  * Thanks screen
  * In game screen
  * mvp screen
  * after-game screen (leave screen)
Once in game it can track:
* Own hero HP
* Map:
  * own structures
  * enemy structures
  * camps / objectives
  * Player position (dodgy)

All this is possible tanks to the use of the opencv2 library.
It uses 2 types of matching, color matching and tempalte matching to determine the game state and track structures players and hp. 

The short-term goal is to make it gather enough data to feed to the ML algorithm.

websocket and webapp server needs a rabbitmq instance running on localhost:5672. you can checkout app state updating in real-time at http://localhost:3000

Data that remains to be acquired:
1. enemy and allied heroes position in the hero's FoV
2. track enemy and friendly minions in the hero FoV
3. Teams' level (OCR)
4. Own cooldowns (OCR)
5. determine What own spells do (it needs to be as generic as possible) ?
